# Quantum Computers And Its Potential Application

## Introduction: What is a Quantum Computer?

A **Quantum computer** is a machine that performs calculations based on the laws of Quantum Mechanics, which is the study of the behavior of particles at the sub-atomic level. it takes advantage of the strange ability of subatomic particles to exist in more than one state, and it allows the computer to do multiple calculations at the same time, which speeds up the process of solving a problem.

## How do Quantum Computers Work diffrentlly from Classical Computer?
A classical computer performs operations using classical bits, which can be either `0` or `1`. But the quantum computer uses Quantum bits or **Qubits** and **they can be `0`, `1` and both at the same time**. 
There are a number of physical objects that can be used as a qubit, like a _single Photon, a nucleus or an electron_. All of these qubits has the property Spin, for an electron the highest energy state clalled **Spin Up** and the lowest energy state called **Spin Down**  .
Now, so far, this is basically just like a classical bit. It's got two states spin-up and spin-down which are like the classical `0` and `1`.
But the intreasting thing about Quantum objects is that they can be in both States at same time. Now, when we measure the spin, it will be either up or down. But before we measurement the qubits are existing in what's called a Quantum superposition. And the coefficients that indicates, the relative probability of finding the electron in one state or the other.
But the beauty of quantum computation can be seen when we considering two, interacting Quantum bits. there are four possible states of these two qubits.
We could think that. Well, that's just like two bits of a classical computer, right? If we have two bits we can write 00, 01, 10, 11. There are four numbers, but still just 2 bits of information. The first bit and the second bit values can determine the respective number.
But in Qubits, Quantum mechaniches allows it to make superpositions of each of thease states. like a(00) + b(01) + c(10) + d(11);
So to determine the states of these 2 spin system we need to have 4 bits of information.
for 3 spin system we have 8 bits of info. , and for N spin system we have 2<sup>N</sup> bits of informations.
We all know the power of Exponential. Quantum computers can reduce the complexity of some algorithms exponentially compare to a classical computer.

## 2. Is Quantum Computer the future of classical Computers?

Quantum computers are not classical computers. They are better suited for tasks like cryptography and AI or solving problems that use quantum mechanical phenomena.

Quantum computers can be used to solve problems that classical computers cannot solve. But, they are not a replacement for classical computers. Quantum computing is a new way of thinking and Quantum computers is a new type of Machine.

## Conclusion: 
### Why We Should Care About Quantum Computations.

Quantum computers are a new technology that is on the edge of being developed.

Quantum computers are capable of performing operations that is significantly faster than ever before, this could lead to an increase in the performance of our current devices. 
Quantum computers will also be able to solve problems that classical computers canâ€™t even touch, 
**Like-  Modeling Molecules** and drug interactions, Cryptography ,and my personal favourite Teleportation of information without even physically transmitting the data. Using two entangaled quantum bits that exiest acrose space and time.

It is important for us to care about quantum computing because it has the potential to change everything about how we live and work!
